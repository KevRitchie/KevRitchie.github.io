Iâ€™m a Development Director and software developer working primarily in C# and building things in Azure. A long way from changing screen colours and making music on my C64 back in the early 80s.

Outside of work at [Paradise Computing Ltd](https://www.paradisecomputing.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}; where I've been for 15 years, I'm a Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force Air Cadets and a Sector Commander for [South & East Midlands Wing ATC](https://semidsatc.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}, responsible for providing support and guidance to 6 Squadron Commanders across Northamptonshire and South Leicestershire.  I was previously Commanding Officer at [422 (Corby) Squadron Royal Air Force Air Cadets](http://422corbyatc.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}, one of the largest Squadrons in the Air Training Corps.
