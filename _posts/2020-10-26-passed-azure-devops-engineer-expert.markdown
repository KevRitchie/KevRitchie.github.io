**This was a tough one!**

So having already passed AZ-203 earlier in the year and after weeks of trying to cram in a load of study, I managed to pass another online proctored Microsoft Certification this year, AZ-400 Azure DevOps Engineer Expert.

What I will say about this exam is that you definitely need to know more than just Azure and Azure DevOps.  You have to have a good understanding DevOps processes, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub and other things like Jenkins, Octopus Deploy, Chef, Puppet, Terraform and YAML to name a few.

Here are the resources that I found useful:

* [MS Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer){:target="_blank"}
* [MS Partner Network Training](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/collection/azure-devops-engineer-expert-certification-exam-az-400#/){:target="_blank"}
* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-devops-engineer-az-400){:target="_blank"}

The MS Learn link lays out the prerequisites and skills needed to pass this exam.  What I would say, is try and get as much hands on experience as you can.  Nothing can beat that.  The MS Learn courses do have Sandboxes which is a great feature.  And if you don't have an Azure Subscription, you can get 12 months of free services [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/){:target="_blank"}.
