**So where have you been all this time! 7 years is a long time, right?**

So, where have I been all this time?

You probably didn't notice, but the content on my website stopped some 7 years ago now!

In short, life has been super busy.

I married my gorgeous wife, commissioned into the RAF Volunteer Reserve (Training) Branch within the Air Training Corps; building up a successful Squadron with over 100 Cadets, and welcomed our little monkey; Amber, into the world!

Our daughter brings us joy everyday and certainly keeps us on our toes.  You can keep up with her antics over on her Facebook Page [Up Side of Down's](https://www.facebook.com/UpSideOfDownsUK/).  I guarantee her content will be more entertaining than mine.
